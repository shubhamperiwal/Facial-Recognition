# Facial-Recognition
This project detects a person's facial recognition and aims to test the security of using open-source libraries like OpenCV to develop such a software

## What I learned from this project

- How to read in an image from a webcam
- How to draw shapes on the image read from webcam and overlay text
- How to train and predict faces using OpenCV
